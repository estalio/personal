            <h2>Ernest Hemingway</h2>
            <p>
              Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899 â€“ July 2, 1961) was an American author and journalist. His
              economical and understated style had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life of
              adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work
              between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published
              seven novels, six short story collections, and two non-fiction works. Additional works, including
              three novels, four short story collections, and three non-fiction works, were published posthumously.
              Many of his works are considered classics of American literature.

              Hemingway was raised in Oak Park, Illinois. After high school he reported for a few months for The
              Kansas City Star, before leaving for the Italian front to enlist with the World War I ambulance
              drivers. In 1918, he was seriously wounded and returned home. His wartime experiences formed the
              basis for his novel A Farewell to Arms (1929).

              In 1921, he married Hadley Richardson, the first of his four wives. The couple moved to Paris, where
              he worked as a foreign correspondent and fell under the influence of the modernist writers and artists
              of the 1920s "Lost Generation" expatriate community. He published his first novel, The Sun Also Rises
              in 1926. After his 1927 divorce from Hadley Richardson, Hemingway married Pauline Pfeiffer; they
              divorced after he returned from the Spanish Civil War where he had been a journalist, and after which
              he wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940). Martha Gellhorn became his third wife in 1940; they separated
              when he met Mary Welsh in London during World War II. He was present at the Normandy Landings and the
              liberation of Paris.

            <p>
              Shortly after the publication of The Old Man and the Sea (1952), Hemingway went on safari to Africa,
              where he was almost killed in two successive plane crashes that left him in pain or ill health for
              much of his remaining lifetime. Hemingway maintained permanent residences in Key West, Florida (1930s)
              and Cuba (1940s and 1950s), and in 1959, he bought a house in Ketchum, Idaho, where he committed suicide
              in the summer of 1961.
